- 👋 Hello, I'm @ mathematica-statistic. But my mother called me Gernot.
- 👀 Analyzing things is my passion. In this path I want to visualize the procedures from two books on economic and social statistics. 
-    To show or better simulate the influence of the population's data on statistical parameters.
- 🌱 I think Mathematica is best for this because:
--  You can concentrate on the core problem and calculate as quickly as you would with pen and paper.
--  Because any programming style is possible and the math of the world is in the tool case.
--  Because dynamic variables make every simulation an experience.
- 📫 You can also reach me at gernot.pascher@hotmal.com
- 💞️ Write if you have a hint or need something.
